	- from n-1 partial solution to n partial (only take the best solution of previous step): think about what an OPTIMAL solution at step n should look like
	- how to prove it is correct: sub-optimal always leads to optimal
	- [discussion on "greedy stays ahead"](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs161/cs161.1138/handouts/120%20Guide%20to%20Greedy%20Algorithms.pdf)

	- Napkin calculation - 100M steps per second on a modern machine.
	- Doing the plan (algorithm, calculation) in your mind is the key to competitive computation.
	- Good habits: 
		- write comments before code
		- do napkin computation
		- start with brute force, sorting, and problem recognition (e.g. graph) and then divide-and-conquer.
		- leave the debug code and toggle them on and off.
		- use assert for defensive coding.
