The kits were hand-built by Wozniak[24][25] and first shown to the public at the Homebrew Computer Club.[26] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips), which is less than what is today considered a complete personal computer.[27] The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 and was market-priced at $666.66 ($2,690 in 2013 dollars, adjusted for inflation).[28][29][30][31][32][33]\n",

        "During the first five years of operations, revenues doubled every four months, an average growth rate of 700%.\n",
        "The Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire. It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, due to its character cell-based color graphics and an open architecture. While early models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5 1/4 inch floppy disk drive and interface, the Disk II.[36]\n",
        "The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first \"killer app\" of the business world, VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program.[37] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users compatibility with the office, an additional reason to buy an Apple II.[37] Apple was a distant third place to Commodore and Tandy until VisiCalc came along.[38][39]\n",
        "By the end of the 1970s, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line. The company introduced the Apple III in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with IBM and Microsoft in the business and corporate computing market.[40]\n",

Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares (800,000 split-adjusted shares) of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[41] Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface (GUI), and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa.[42]\n",
        "On December 12, 1980, Apple went public at $22 per share,[43] generating more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956 and instantly creating more millionaires (about 300) than any company in history.[44]\n",

A race broke out between the Lisa team and the Macintosh team over which product would ship first. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.[45]\n",

It was directed by Ridley Scott and was aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[46] It is now hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success[47] and a \"masterpiece\".[48][49]\n",
        "The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong[50] due to its high price and limited range of software titles. The Macintosh was the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language at all.[51]\n",

It has been suggested that the combination of these three products was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[52] The Mac was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.\n",
        "In 1985 a power struggle developed between Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired two years earlier.[53] The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to \"contain\" Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.[50] Jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT Inc. the same year.[54]\n",

After the Macintosh Portable, Apple introduced the PowerBook in 1991. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for Mac OS until 2001.\n",
        "The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.[53] For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.\n",
        "Following the success of the Macintosh LC, Apple introduced the Centris line, a low-end Quadra, and the ill-fated Performa line that was sold with an overwhelming number of configurations and software bundles to avoid competing with the various consumer outlets such as Sears, Price Club, and Wal-Mart (the primary dealers for these models). Consumers ended up confused and did not understand the difference between models.[55]\n",
        "During this time Apple experimented with a number of other failed consumer targeted products including digital cameras, portable CD audio players, speakers, video consoles, and TV appliances. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued Newton division based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.[citation needed] Ultimately, none of these products helped, as Apple's market share and stock prices continued to slide.[citation needed]\n",
        "Apple saw the Apple II series as too expensive to produce, while taking away sales from the low end Macintosh.[56] In 1990, Apple released the Macintosh LC with a single expansion slot for the Apple IIe Card to migrate Apple II users to the Macintosh platform.[56] Apple stopped selling the Apple IIe in 1993.\n",
        "Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while Apple was delivering a richly engineered, but expensive, experience.[57] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response. Instead, they sued Microsoft for using a graphical user interface similar to the Apple Lisa in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation.[58] The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed.

        "By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as the A/UX. Apple had also begun to experiment in providing a Mac-only online portal which they called eWorld, developed in collaboration with America Online and designed as a Mac-friendly alternative to other online services such as CompuServe. The Macintosh platform was itself becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking, and several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from OS/2 and UNIX vendors such as Sun Microsystems. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform, or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.[60]\n",
        "In 1994, Apple allied with IBM and Motorola in the AIM alliance. The goal was to create a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple's software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind, thus countering Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's PowerPC processor.[61]\n",
        "In 1996, Michael Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO. Gil Amelio made many changes at Apple, including extensive layoffs.[62] After numerous failed attempts to improve Mac OS, first with the Taligent project, then later with Copland and Gershwin, Amelio chose to purchase NeXT and its NeXTSTEP operating system, bringing Steve Jobs back to Apple as an advisor.[63] On July 9, 1997, Gil Amelio was ousted by the board of directors after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses. Jobs became the interim CEO and began restructuring the company's product line.\n",

In 1998, Apple announced the purchase of Macromedia's Final Cut software, signaling its expansion into the digital video editing market.[70] The following year, Apple released two video editing products: iMovie for consumers and, for professionals, Final Cut Pro, which has gone on to be a significant video-editing program, with 800,000 registered users in early 2007.[71] In 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake,[72] as well as Emagic for their music productivity application Logic, which led to the development of their consumer-level GarageBand application.[73][74] iPhoto's release the same year completed the iLife suite.[75]\n",

The event also saw the announcement of the iPhone and the Apple TV.[90] The following day, Apple shares hit $97.80, an all-time high at that point. In May, Apple's share price passed the $100 mark.[91]\n",

The flat silver back and large antenna square of the original model were eliminated in favor of a curved glossy black or white back. Following customer complaints, the previously-recessed headphone jack was changed to a flush jack for compatibility with more styles of headphones.

Shortly after its release, reception issues were discovered by consumers, due to the stainless steel band around the edge of the device, which also serves as the phone's cellular signal and Wi-Fi antenna. The issue was corrected by a \"Bumper Case\" distributed by Apple for free to all owners for a few months.

On October 19, 2011, Apple announced an agreement with C Spire Wireless to sell the iPhone 4S with that carrier in the near future, marking the first time the iPhone was officially supported on a regional carrier's network.[181] Another notable feature of the iPhone 4S was Siri voice assistant technology, which Apple had acquired in 2010,[182] as well as other features, including an updated 8MP camera with new optics.

It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's \"rainbow Apple\", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the \"bitten\" logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. While Jobs liked the logo, he insisted it be in color to humanize the company.[202][203] The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.[204] The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.[204] This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide.[205][206] Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.[204][207]\n",
        "In 1998, with the roll-out of the new iMac, Apple discontinued the rainbow theme and began to use monochromatic themes, nearly identical in shape to its previous rainbow incarnation, on various products, packaging and advertising. An Aqua-themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 2001\u20132003, and a Glass-themed version has been used since 2003.\n",

Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism \"something that was stumbled upon\".[220] Apple has, however, supported the continuing existence of a network of Mac User Groups in most major and many minor centers of population where Mac computers are available.\n",
        "Mac users would meet at the European Apple Expo and the San Francisco Macworld Conference & Expo trade shows where Apple traditionally introduced new products each year to the industry and public until Apple pulled out of both events. While the conferences continue, Apple does not have official representation there. Mac developers, in turn, continue to gather at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference.\n",
        "Apple Store openings can draw crowds of thousands, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event.[221] The New York City Fifth Avenue \"Cube\" store had a line as long as half a mile; a few Mac fans took the opportunity of the setting to propose marriage.[222] The Ginza opening in Tokyo was estimated in the thousands with a line exceeding eight city blocks.[223]\n",
        "John Sculley told The Guardian newspaper in 1997: \"People talk about technology, but Apple was a marketing company. It was the marketing company of the decade.\"[224] Research in 2002 by NetRatings indicate that the average Apple consumer was usually more affluent and better educated than other PC company consumers. The research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average Apple Inc. products are more expensive than other PC products.[225][226]\n",

        "During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.[227] This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s beginning with Apple's adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500/8500/9500 Power Macs. Apple has since adopted USB, AGP, HyperTransport, Wi-Fi, and other industry standards in its computers and was in some cases a leader in the adoption of standards such as USB.[228] FireWire is an Apple-originated standard that has seen widespread industry adoption after it was standardized as IEEE 1394.[229]\n",
        "Ever since the first Apple Store opened, Apple has sold third-party accessories.[230] For instance, at one point Nikon and Canon digital cameras were sold inside the store. Adobe, one of Apple's oldest software partners,[231] also sells its Mac-compatible software, as does Microsoft, who sells Microsoft Office for the Mac. Books from John Wiley & Sons, who publishes the For Dummies series of instructional books, are a notable exception, however. The publisher's line of books were banned from Apple Stores in 2005 because Steve Jobs disagreed with their decision to publish an unauthorized Jobs biography, iCon.[232] After the launch of the iBookstore, Apple stopped selling physical books, both online and at the Apple Retail Stores.\n",

        "Apple Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in the middle of Silicon Valley, at 1\u20136 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California. This Apple campus has six buildings that total 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2) and was built in 1993 by Sobrato Development Cos.[233]\n",
        "In 2006, Apple announced its intention to build a second campus on 50 acres (200,000 m2) assembled from various contiguous plots (east of N Wolfe Road between Pruneridge Avenue and Vallco Parkway). Later acquisitions increased this to 175 acres. The new campus, also in Cupertino, will be about 1 mile (1.6 km) east of the current campus.[234] The new campus building will be designed by Norman Foster.[235]\n",
        "On June 7, 2011, Steve Jobs gave a presentation to Cupertino City Council, detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs. The new campus is planned to house up to 13,000 employees in one central four-storied circular building (with a caf\u00e9 for 3,000 sitting people integrated) surrounded by extensive landscape (with parking mainly underground and the rest centralized in a parking structure). There will be additional buildings such as an auditorium, R&D facilities, a fitness center and a dedicated generating plant as primary source of electricity (powered by natural gas and other more environmentally sound means).[citation needed]\n",
        "Apple's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in Cork in the south of Ireland.[236][237][238][239][240][241][242] The facility, which opened in 1980, was Apple's first location outside of the United States.[243] Apple Sales International, which deals with all of Apple's international sales outside of the USA, is located at Apple's campus in Cork[244] along with Apple Distribution International, which similarly deals with Apple's international distribution network.[245]\n",
        "On April 20, 2012, Apple announced the addition of 500 new jobs to its European headquarters. This will bring the total workforce from around 2,800 to 3,300 employees.[236][237][246] The company will build a new office block on its Hollyhill Campus to accommodate the additional staff.[247]\n",
        "Corporate culture\n",
        "Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of what a corporate culture should look like in organizational hierarchy (flat versus tall, casual versus formal attire, etc.). Other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same period include Southwest Airlines and Microsoft. Originally, the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like IBM by default, thanks to the influence of its founders; Steve Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple was a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" TV ad, this trait had become a key way the company attempted to differentiate itself from its competitors.[248] According to a 2011 report in Fortune, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[249]\n",
        "As the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives, each with his own idea of what Apple should be, some of its original character has arguably been lost, but Apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its employ. This was especially after Jobs' return. To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program, awarding individuals who made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to a few individuals including Bill Atkinson,[250] Steve Capps,[251] Rod Holt,[250] Alan Kay,[252][253] Guy Kawasaki,[252][254] Al Alcorn,[255] Don Norman,[252] Rich Page,[250] and Steve Wozniak.[250]\n",
        "Apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a \"directly responsible individual,\" or \"DRI\" in Apple jargon.[249] As an example, when iOS senior vice president Scott Forstall refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned Maps app, he was forced to resign.[256]\n",
        "Numerous employees of Apple have cited that projects without Jobs' involvement often took longer than projects with his involvement.[257]\n",
        "At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having best-in-class employees in every role. For instance, Ron Johnson who was Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011, was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet he had no control of the inventory in his stores (which is done company wide by then-COO and now CEO Tim Cook who has a background in supply-chain management). This is the opposite of General Electric's corporate culture which has created well-rounded managers.[258][258]\n",
        "Under the leadership of Tim Cook who joined the company in 1998 and ascended to his present position as CEO, Apple has developed an extremely efficient and effective supply chain which has been ranked as the world's best for the four years 2007\u20132010.[citation needed] The company's manufacturing, procurement and logistics enables it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories; Apple's profit margins have been 40 percent compared with 10\u201320 percent for most other hardware companies in 2011. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational edge is \u201cNobody wants to buy sour milk\u201d.[114][259]\n",
        "The company previously advertised its products as being made in America up to the late 1990s, however as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s almost all of its manufacturing is now done abroad. According to a report by the New York Times, Apple insiders \"believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that \u201cMade in the U.S.A.\u201d is no longer a viable option for most Apple products\".[260]\n",
        "Unlike other major US companies, Apple has a relatively simple compensation policy for executives, which does not include perks that other CEOs enjoy such as country club fees and private use of company aircraft. The company usually grants stock options to executives every other year.[261]\n",
        "A media article published in July 2013 provided details about Apple's \"At-Home Apple Advisors\" customer support program that serves as the corporation's call center. The advisors are employed within the U.S. and work remotely after undergoing a four-week training program that also serves as a testing period. The advisors earn between US$9 and $12 per hour, and receive intensive management to ensure a high quality of customer support.[262]\n",

        "In November 2011, Apple featured in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how \"green\" their products are. The company ranked 4th out of 15 electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10 down from 4.9.[287] Greenpeace praises Apple's sustainability, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. It continues to score well on the products rating with all Apple products now being free of PVC vinyl plastic and brominated flame retardants. However, the guide criticizes Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data and for not setting out any targets to reduce emissions.[287] In January 2012, Apple announced plans and requested that their cable maker Volex begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.[288]\n",

The article also reported that workers made around $100 per month and were required to live pay for rent and food from the company, which generally amounted to a little over half of workers' earnings.[16][293][294]\n",
        "Apple immediately launched an investigation and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions.[295] In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker's rights, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published since 2008.[296] In 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.[297] After a spate of suicides in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit at a lower rate than in China as a whole,[298] workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.[299]\n",

According to the New York Times, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \"Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich,\" which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.[305]\n",

He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and Coca-Cola, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues.

        "10 Apple already plans to buy back $100 billion in shares, including $16 billion worth last quarter. Icahn probably pounded the dinner table he and Cook shared recently for their much-reported bread-breaking at Icahn's New York apartment. Apple's cash stash currently sits at a whopping $145 billion but only $43 billion is in the U.S., which is why Icahn wants to float bonds to cover a buy back. Fortunately, there are \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdlow-chill\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd apple varieties for temperate climates. (Chilling hours are defined as nonconsecutive hours of winter temperatures below 45 degrees.) As a general guide, if you live on or near the coast, your garden gets only 100 to 200 chilling hours. Inland San Diego gardens get about 400 to 500 chilling hours \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd still considered \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdlow chill.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd If this seems a bit like d\ufffd\ufffdj\ufffd\ufffd vu, you\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdll recall that Apple just held an event to unveil two new iPhone models \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd the 5c and 5s \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd back on September 10. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdBoth Samsung and Apple are important contributors to the U.S. economy and help advance innovation and technological progress,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd the trade representative said as part of its statement. Icahn says he has claimed a sizeable stake in Apple, and he wants Cook to take advantage of low interest rates to issue bonds to finance the additional buyback. While Icahn is wont to wax aimlessly on CNBC about what a great company Apple is and how loyal its customers are, the activist investor probably does not care about Apple employees or the future of the Cupertino, Calif., company. He's looking for a quick killing before he's on to the next thing, which is what he does. This ingredient can be used the same way as other vinegars \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd it's great as a component of homemade salad dressings, for example. But some people get a bit more extreme than that, drinking it as a tonic or even taking it straight because of its purported health effects. Some of the claims of the ingredient's benefits are overblown, but there are still many reasons to bring a bottle of apple cider vinegar into your pantry. Here are 12 of them, from the top of your head to Fido's furry paws. Ursolic acid - a waxy substance found in apple peel - increases muscle and brown fat in mice that are on a high-fat diet. Apples are known to contain pectin, a soluble fiber. They also have insoluble fiber. Increased fiber intake has been linked with improvements in blood lipid levels. Eating a medium-sized apple, with the skin, provides about 4 grams of fiber. Most of the fibre in apples comes from the skin and the pulp. When you remove the skin, you remove about half the fibre. A medium apple with skin contains 3.3 grams of fibre, whereas a medium without skin has only 1.7 grams. Apple-sauce and apple juice contain even less. Dietary fibre is important for weight management, because it keeps you fuller longer. Dietary fibre from fruit, as part of an overall healthful diet, helps reduce blood cholesterol levels and might lower the risk of heart disease, obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Plus, fibre aids in proper bowel function and helps to reduce constipation. The fifth-generation iPad is expected to feature a thinner, lighter design akin to the iPad mini\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds, and an improved camera. It will run Apple\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds new 64-bit A7 chip. The second-generation iPad mini will be upgraded with a retina display and also likely see the A7 incorporated into its innards. It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds not clear whether Apple\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds new iPads will feature the Touch ID fingerprint sensor that recently debuted on the iPhone 5s, though that has been rumored.\n"
